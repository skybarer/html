        document.write("Switched networks introduce \u0022 redundancy\u0027, so an STP loop-avoidance mechanism is needed to prevent undesirable loops. Most complex networks include redundant devices to avoid single points of failure.\n Although a redundant topology eliminates some issues, it can introduce other problems. STP is a Layer 2 link management protocol that provides path redundancy while preventing undesirable loops in a switched network. \u2028 This course closes with a review of the problems that are caused by redundant switched-network topologies and the functions of STP that prevent these problems.
